First, it is not necessary to import constructors.
But it removes unnecessary procedures from the environment in which users operate most 

It works because now when number is identified as complex,
The generic selectors will strip the 'complex tag and call themselves
again now on the same number with its second type tag now exposed,
in this case either 'polar or 'rectangular, and these generic selectors will dispatch an appropriate procedure
on the given type. Since for these types an appropriate selector procedure has been defined in 2.4,
it works.

It didn't work before because a number with the first type tag 'complex
never had an appropriate procedure dispatch(entry in the table) for selectors(their names) such as real-part, imag-part
magnitude and angle
Therefore, generic selectors didn't work

It took advantage of the generic selector procedures in a complex number package
by using them as generic selectors for a general arithmetic package

They have two roles:
Identify a complex number, strip the first tag and do the latter:
Identify a type of the complex number, strip the second tag and dispatch an appropriate procedure


(define z (make-complex-from-real-imag 3 4))

Applicative-order:
[procedure names are left in their place instead of the object they evaluate to]

(magnitude z)

(magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 4))

(apply-generic 'magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 4))

(let ((type-tags (map type-tag '((complex rectangular 3 4)))))
    (let ((proc (get 'magnitude type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents '((complex rectangular 3 4))))
          (error
            "No method for these types:
             APPLY-GENERIC"
            (list 'magnitude type-tags)))))

results in proc being the same procedure magnitude that was applied earlier

(magnitude '(rectangular 3 4))

(apply-generic 'magnitude '(rectangular 3 4))

(let ((type-tags (map type-tag '((rectangular 3 4)))))
    (let ((proc (get 'magnitude type-tags)))
      (if proc
          (apply proc (map contents '((rectangular 3 4))))
          (error
            "No method for these types:
             APPLY-GENERIC"
            (list 'magnitude type-tags)))))

results in proc being a Ben's procedure to extract magnitude from a rectangular form

real-part and imag-part, magnitude are not the generic selectors. They are from Ben's package

(magnitude '(3 4))

(sqrt (+ (square (real-part '(3 4)))
         (square (imag-part '(3 4)))))

(sqrt (+ (square 3)
         (square 4)))

5

Initially the dispatched procedure was the generic selector magnitude, i.e. magnitude dispatched itself
on a striped(from its first tag) rectangular complex number

Then it dispatched Ben's magnitude procedure on a striped(from its first and second tags)
rectangular complex number

Apply-generic was called twice
