subtracting from some greatest value k some least value j yields the greatest value among possible results

subtracting from some least value i some greatest value u yields the least value among possible results.

Therefore, the sub-interval should be implemented as follows:

x - y

(define (sub-interval x y)
 (make-interval (- (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                (- (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
