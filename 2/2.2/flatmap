(define (flatmap op seqs)
 (accumulate (lambda (x y) (append (op x) y)) '() seqs))

Spread-out mapping before appending vs. appending mapped
 works because accumulate is actually a generalized map procedure.
It is slightly faster as the it does not have to go over the elements of the sequence
twice.
