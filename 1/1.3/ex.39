Notice that nk for k > 1 is actually (square x)
while for n1 x.
(lambda (i) (if (= i 1)
                x
                (- (square x))))
is suitable as well.

dk is the k odd number = 2j + 1 = 2(k - 1) + 1 = 2k - 1.

(define (tan-cf x k)
 (cont-frac (lambda (k) (* x 1.0
                           (if (= 1 k)
                               1
                               (- x))))
            (lambda (y) (- (* 2 y) 1.0))
            k))
