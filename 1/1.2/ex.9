(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)

      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

analogous to splitting a into 1s and them adding them consequently to b

a recursive process, a linear recursive process.

as a increases, the amount of deferred inc procedures and, hence, computation steps increases at the same rate.
(if a is increased by 1, then it adds 1 more to the amount of inc procedures)

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))



(+ 4 5).

(+ 0 9)|
9 <----'

an iterative process, a linear iterative process.

as a increases, the amount of computation steps increases at the same rate.

(if a is increased by, one, then it takes 1 more step)


In either case, the value of b does not matter, it does not affect the amount of steps.
But it could be optimized so that if b = 0, the the result is a, immediately.
