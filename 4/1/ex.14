This primitive applies the procedure object from the
new evaluator implementation as the object in the underlying scheme,
which is not applicable there as its apply/map apparently utilizez a different implementation of procedure objects.

(define (map proc L)
  (if (null? L)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car L))
            (map proc (cdr L)))))
