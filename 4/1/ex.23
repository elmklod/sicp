one-element sequence will incur overhead for Alyssa's version as it
evaluates an extra lambda-expression and execute-sequence
each time the sequence is evaluated.

2+ -element version is not that clear.
Original evaluates n-1 lambda expressions while Alyssa's loops n times through the
analyzed elements of the sequence + 1 lambda expression

Overall, Alyssa's seems to be more expensive when the sequence is called more than once
The more it is evaluated, the more expensive Alyssa's version is

The problem is that lambda expression may require as much resources as Alyssa's loop
