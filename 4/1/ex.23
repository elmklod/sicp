one-element sequence will incur overhead for Alyssa's version as it
evaluates and extra lambda-expression and execute-sequence
each time the sequence is evaluated.

2+ -element version is not that clear.
Original evaluates n-1 lambda expressions while Alyssa's loops n times through the
analyzed elements of the sequence + 1 lambda expression

Overall, Alyssa's seems to be more expensive when the sequence is called more than once
The more it is evaluated, the more expensive Alyssa's version is
