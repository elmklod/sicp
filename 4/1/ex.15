(define (run-forever)
  (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))

Evaluate (try try)
suppose (halts? p p) ==
(halts? try try) returns #t == (try try) halts
Then initial (try try) never halts.
A contradiction

Suppose (halts? p p) ==
(halts? try try) returns #f == (try try) never halts.
Then initial (try try) halts by returning 'halted
A contradiction

Therefore , because all other programs exists,
halts? does not/cannot exist.
