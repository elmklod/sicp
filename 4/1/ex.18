This version will work with this implementation of simultaneous  definitions.

The version in the book will fail with this new implementation of the simultaneous
scope. But it will work with the implementation from the exercise 4.16
The reason for that is the new version does not allow for the value expressions
to be evaluated with the access to some (internal) variables already possessing a value.
The initial version allowed for this to happen. But in the unspecified order.
As it is given in the book, it would evaluate definitions in the order in which they appear in the procedure body.
As it turns out, my implementation from the ex. 4.16 will fail as well, because it reverses the order of definitions.

It is also possible to implement this version without the additional frame as in the exercise 4.17
