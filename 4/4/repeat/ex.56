; question concerning implementation:
; can lisp-value(and 'not') form be intermixed with other queries?
; can it go first or in the middle?
; implementation dependent
; does the order of queries affect the way the search is performed?
; if so, it affects performance greatly

; more declarative and less repititive, better in many cases, unless pattern matching is very cheap
; and traversing a db is not(to get to the rule db)
