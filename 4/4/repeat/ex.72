; The answer is the same as for ex.71:
; For efficiency reasons
; Otherwise each or- clause would have to be evaluated completely / or every query would have to be evaluated against the given frame
; with all assertions matched and all rules applied(unified before that) (recursively until there is no delayed part of the stream or the evaluator loops)

; ---- stream-flatmap specific
; the first object mapped produces a stream far longer than any output stream of other objects or takes more resources to produce a stream of less or similar length
; then to get to the objects within those next streams, the whole stream for the first object has to be created
; which takes may decrease the the average rate at which objects within the streams appear or the diversity of these objects

; e.g. When simple query is processed in the middle of some and-query
; the extended frames for the frames that are buried further in the streams
; won't be created and, therefore, known about by the user or system
; until all extension possibilities for the previous(outer) frames are exhausted

; ---- or-specific
; with all possible frames
; before any frame from next clauses can appear
; making it impractical as there may be less computationally expensive answers that are not
; shown earlier than all possible answers of the previous clause



; an argument for interleaved disjoin:
; suppose there is a rule
(rule (long ?x) *something that takes a lot of time to evaluate*)
; and suppose that there are many values that will satisfy the query (long ?x)
; (found by evaluating rule body that matches it against assertions and unifies it with rule conclusions)

; and suppose there is query being evaluated
(or (long ?x) *some query that is not a rule and does not contain a rule in case of compound query, it evalautes far faster than the long application*)

; if the disjoin procedure does not interleave or- clauses
; then the frames extended by evaluating the second clause won't get into the output stream of frames
; until all possible frames for the first clause are created
; which slows down the amount of frames that are created over time on average
; with interleaving it would make the rate at which new frames appear more averaged for small amount of time
; better than the worst possible case and worse than the best case
