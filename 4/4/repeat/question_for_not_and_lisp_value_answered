what happens when not and lisp-value forms are given
new patterns?
In case of not it seems that a valid option is to check whether the match(unification) is consistent
even if some patterns are unassigned
For lisp-value it is not clear what to do. Signaling an error is one solution.

Answer: It is really unclear and almost every reasonable solution is about delaying
filtering until there is enough bindings in the frame for filters to work properly
