(wheel ?who)

; query results:
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Bitdiddle Ben))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))

; Inspect the rule definition:

(rule (wheel ?person)
      (and (supervisor ?middle-manager
                       ?person)
           (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))

; There are only 2 people in the company who supervise supervisors
; It's (Bitdiddle Ben) and (Warbucks Oliver)
; the only possible values for ?person pattern are their names,
; so even with the repetitions the results are logically correct.

; when the first and-clause of rule body is evaluated, it generates 8 frames, one for each supervisor(value assigned to ?person patt.)
; and all people being supervised (?middle-manager patt.)
; but when the assertions db was matched, there were assertions of one person supervising several people at once:
(supervisor (Aull DeWitt) (Warbucks Oliver))
(supervisor (Cratchet Robert) (Scrooge Eben))
(supervisor (Scrooge Eben) (Warbucks Oliver))
(supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))
(supervisor (Reasoner Louis)
            (Hacker Alyssa P))
(supervisor (Tweakit Lem E) (Bitdiddle Ben))
(supervisor (Fect Cy D) (Bitdiddle Ben))
(supervisor (Hacker Alyssa P) (Bitdiddle Ben))
; and for each such assertion a frame was created regardless of the assignment repetitions
; there are 3 frames with ?person assigned to (Warbucks Oliver):
; ?who = ?person is omitted for clarity
; a) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Aull DeWitt)
; b) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Scrooge Eben)
; c) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Bitdiddle Ben)
;
; 3 to (Bitdiddle Ben):
; a) ?person = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?middle-manager = (Tweakit Lem E)
; b) ?person = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?middle-manager = (Fect Cy D)
; c) ?person = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?middle-manager = (Hacker Alyssa P)
;
; 1 to (Hacker Alyssa P):
; ?person = (Hacker Alyssa P); ?middle-manager = (Reasoner Louis)
; 1 to (Scrooge Eben):
; ?person = (Scrooge Eben); ?middle-manager = (Cratchet Robert)
; then the second clause is evaluated for each frame.(the numeration is in accordance with how they are listed here)
; there is no one supervised by (Aull DeWitt), so the query fails for the first frame
; there is (Cratchet Robert) supervised by (Scrooge Eben) and he supervises no one else, the second frame is extended once:
; ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Scrooge Eben); ?x = (Cratchet Robert)
; there are 3 people supervised by (Bitdiddle Ben), the third frame is extended thrice(three frames are produced):
; a) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?x = (Tweakit Lem E)
; b) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?x = (Fect Cy D)
; c) ?person = (Warbucks Oliver); ?middle-manager = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?x = (Hacker Alyssa P)
; there is no one supervised by (Tweakit Lem E), the query fails for the fourth frame.
; there is no one supervised by (Fect Cy D), the query fails for the fifth frame.
; there is (Reasoner Louis) supervised by (Hacker Alyssa P) and she supervises no one else, the sixth frame is extended once:
; ?person = (Bitdiddle Ben); ?middle-manager = (Hacker Alyssa P); ?x = (Reasoner Louis)
; there is no one supervised by (Reasoner Louis), the query fails for the seventh frame.
; there is no one supervised by (Cratchet Robert), the query fails for the eighth frame.

; Overall 5 frames are produced:
; in one of them ?person is bound to (Bitdiddle Ben)
; in 4 others, it is bound to (Warbucks Oliver)
; which consequently makes 4 ?who patterns bound to (Warbucks Oliver)
; and 1 to (Bitdiddle Ben)

; For each such frame the original query is instantiated with the values in frames,
; that is why Oliver Warbucks is listed four times.
