(meeting accounting (Monday 9am))

; I wonder what happens when there is a query

(meeting-time ?person (Friday 3pm))
; and there is an assertion
(meeting whole-company (Friday 3pm))

; then the ?person pattern will never be matched against any value
; does it lead to an error?
; It is correct, however, since it is true for any person
; But with a condition that this person works for a company.
; Therefore, there may be values(names) for which this query will
; return false results if ?person is not matched.

; To remedy this:

(rule (meeting-time ?person ?day-and-time)
  (and (job ?person (?division . ?title))
       (or (meeting whole-company ?day-and-time)
           (meeting ?division ?day-and-time))))

; It requires a careful examination to deduce which is more optimal.
; Probably there are on par and the last version is correct.

; If there are repetitions, then some meeting times coincide, which is the company schedule problem,
; not the query language
