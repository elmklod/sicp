It is possible to ask for a query (rule *something*)
and this will be a query, not a definition of a rule.

I wonder why authors preferred to add rules via assert! instead
of making (rule <...>) a special form

Maybe the word 'rule' is used often in dbes in simple assertions
They have gone for simplicity of the code, but not the simplicity of the resulting structure
It is possible that I am too adjusted to the convenient Scheme syntax and semantics.
