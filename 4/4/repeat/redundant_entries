One can add same assertions and rules more than once
Unique form from ex.75 treats them as unsuitable.
It may be desirable to perform search on streams before adding new rules or assertions
How to perform it if the stream evaluation is delayed
Delaying search is not an option, it has to perform its search on the whole stream
(or in case of the indexable rule/assertion on just the indexed part, adding to the required streams if the the search fails)
How is storing rules and assertion in streams beneficial?
They are already evaluated as the read procedure transformed characters to data structures
Streams here take more memory, more time to force already evaluated data
Switching at least to lists is recommended.
