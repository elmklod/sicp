(meeting ?division (Friday ?time))

; ?time could perhaps be divided to specifically query for the morning meetings.

(rule (meeting-time ?person ?day-and-time)
  (or (meeting whole-company ?day-and-time)
       (and (job ?person (?division . ?position))
            (meeting ?division ?day-and-time))))

(meeting-time Alyssa (Wednesday ?time)) ; can be without .

; maybe  with

(and (meeting-time Alyssa (Wednesday ?time))
     (meeting ?division (Wednesday ?time)))

If there is ambiguity, she should clarify that.
