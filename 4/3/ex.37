Yes, he is correct

First, inappropriate combinations of i and j are dismissed before k is computed.

However, sqrt procedure may require some steps to compute k.
If one ignores sqrt, then only i and j whose sum of squares is less than (square high)
are chosen to compute k.
With sqrt, it is unknown.
Either the original traverses more k's for inappropriate combinations of i and j or
(sqrt (+ (square i) (square j))) requires more steps.
