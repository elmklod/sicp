It works only if verb-phrase-parsing succeeds in the first place.

If it does not, the procedure will get stuck after 1 failed attempt to parse a verb.
This may occur if the verb is unknown or the sentence has bad grammar and is malformed or when
try-again is evaluated and the sentence structure cannot be parsed in any other way
with additional verb-phrases.
(parse '(the cat shits)); fails as 'shits' is an unknown form of a verb

(parse '(the cat professor)) ; fails as it is grammatically malformed

;;; Amb-Eval input:
(parse '(the cat eats))

;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(sentence (simple-noun-phrase (article the) (noun cat)) (verb eats))

;;; Amb-Eval input:
try-again ; fails as there is no more way known to the parser to parse it



If the order is interchanged, the procedure will never terminate in the first place even if the grammar is correct.
Infinite recursive call inside procedure parse-verb-phrase to itself.

(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb (list
        'verb-phrase
        (parse-verb-phrase)
        (parse-prepositional-phrase))
       (parse-word verbs)))

; (parse '(the cat eats)) ; fails

You did it again, Louis.
