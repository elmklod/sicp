These objects differ from the original by having an environment consisting of a sequence
of 3 frames instead of 2. The extra frame now contain the binding for the variable initial-amount.
Again, this state variable is local for W1 and W2.

Since these structures/objects contain exactly the same code as the original ones
and the local variable initial-amount is not used by the procedures, they behave exactly like the
original ones.
