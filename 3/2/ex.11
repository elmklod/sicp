The local state for acc is kept in the enclosing environment, which was  created during the
the evaluation of the combination of the application of the procedure make-account

It is kept together with the corresponding state-changing procedures.

acc and acc2 share the global frame/environment only.
Probably they also share the code for state-changing procedures. But this is implementation dependent.
