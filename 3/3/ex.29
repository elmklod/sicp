(define (or-gate a1 a2 output)
  (let ((inv-a1 (make-wire))
        (inv-a2 (make-wire))
        (c1 (make-wire)))
    (inverter a1 inv-a1)
    (inverter a2 inv-a2)
    (and-gate inv-a1 inv-a2 c1)
    (inverter c1 output)))

The delay in the real system would be 1 inverter delay + 1 and-gate delay + 1 inverter delay =
2 inv. + 1 and. (which is what will author's simulation will achieve)
However the sequential, non-concurrent simulation(which is caused by
the bad design choices) makes it
3 inv. + 1 and.
