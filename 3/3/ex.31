if there is no initialization, then the action will not be added to the agenda and
when propagate is called, the new action will not be run until the wire it is associated with
changes its value.

This is a bug as, for example, newly generated wires c1 and c2 when
connected to the inverter
(inverter c1 c2) will have (get-signal c1) = (get-signal c1) = 0
no matter how many times (propagate) is evaluated until c1 changes its value to 1

Tracing the half-adder example:


(probe 'sum sum)

(probe 'carry carry)

(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)
ok

(set-signal! input-1 1)
done

; only now actions for wire input-1 are added to the agenda

(propagate)
sum 8  New-value = 1
done

; i1 = 1; i2 = 0; s = 1; c = 0;


(set-signal! input-2 1)
done

; only now actions for wire input-2 are added to the agenda

(propagate)
carry 11  New-value = 1
sum 16  New-value = 0
done
