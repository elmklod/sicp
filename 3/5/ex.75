The bug is that last-value holds the value that is not the average of some value i
with value i-1 but the sum of of all the previous values divided by 2 to the power
of (number of the value currently being ispected - number of the previous value)

To fix this, make-zero-crossing has to take an additional argument previous-value
which will be used to compute the average.

(define (make-zero-crossings
         input-stream last-av-value previous-value)
  (let ((current-value (stream-car input-stream)))
   (let ((avpt
          (/ (+ current-value
                previous-value)
             2)))
     (cons-stream
      (sign-change-detector avpt last-av-value)
      (make-zero-crossings
       (stream-cdr input-stream) avpt current-value)))))
