Louis' procedure would recompute (sqrt-stream x) several time
 the depth at which streams are forced would vary as n-th element of the k-th
stream requires anly (n-1)-th element of the (k+1)-th stream), because the calls this procedure
would produce different streams and the memoization will not take effect.
Therefore, it will take additional time and space.

Yes, they would differ in that Louis' will recreate streams starting from the first element
whereas the original will start recomputing from the first element, never recreating it again.
It may be said that the original still preserves the first element as memoized while
Louis' does not.
Also extra procedure invocation(call) will require more space and time as it will create many environments
all pointing to the global one with the same binding x to the same value.
Therefore, Louis' is still less efficient even without any memoization used (call-by-name)
